== Pact: Concepts

=== Pact: Example

=== Pact: Provider State

=== Pact: Provider Side Changes break Client

* forget IgnoreUnknowns on Java DTO and add additional fields on the Provider.

=== Pact: Matchers

What elements can be matched

https://docs.pact.io/documentation/matching.html
https://github.com/DiUS/pact-jvm/tree/master/pact-jvm-consumer-junit
https://github.com/DiUS/pact-jvm/wiki/Matching#matcher-path-expressions

=== Pact: Findings

Matchers: 85 vs. 85.0
Consumer passing arguments for state changes works only on pact-jvm?

equals is used to compare numbers
matching more complex string cases seem to be fiddly.
maybe lack of knowledge/experience with the tool?
Limitation of the jvm implementation?
